# Trained Agents and Eval Results
All evaluations were carried out using the models and scripts enclosed.
The naming scheme of training runs resembles the enclosed TensorBoard log files
that Stable Baselines 3 created during training. Following table outlines
the mapping between experiments in the thesis and the files.

| Thesis        | TensorBoard |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Experiment 01 |     PPO_001 |
| Experiment 02 |     PPO_014 |
| Experiment 03 |     PPO_016 |
| Experiment 04 |     PPO_017 |
| Experiment 05 |     PPO_023 |
| Experiment 06 |     PPO_042 |
| Experiment 07 |     PPO_043 |
| Experiment 08 |     PPO_044 |
