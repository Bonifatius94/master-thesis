# Master Thesis: Lokale Navigation von Mikromobilit√§tsfahrzeugen mittels Reinforcement Learning

This repository outlines the results of my master thesis on training a little robot
in my own simulator and let it interact with pedestrians controlled by Social Force.

The results show a very promising defensive policy that manages to avoid collisions
with pedestrians entirely, in constrast to prior works with 50% collisions.

## Structure

- maps/ contains the training environments the were used to traing the robot
- proofs/ contains a mathematical proof of the obstacle force as a virtual potential field
- results/ contains videos of the policies, trained agents, training logs and performance profiles
