# Master Thesis: Lokale Navigation von Mikromobilit√§tsfahrzeugen mittels Reinforcement Learning

This repository outlines the results of my master thesis on training a little robot
in my own simulator and letting it interact with pedestrians controlled by Social Force.

The results show a very promising defensive policy that manages to avoid collisions entirely,
given a very dense environment like in crowded pedestrian zones. This defensive policy can be
combined with an offensive policy to maneuver around pedestrians on side-walks with only
a few pedestrians.
